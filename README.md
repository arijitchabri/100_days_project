# 100_days_project
##Following with Udemy Course 100 days of code

I would like to have suggetion to improve my code.
Though in some poins I know my code can be better but I did not change it because it will change the code entirely.
So in those cases I will leave a comment.
And ofcourse there will be a plenty of codes so for better understanding I will address the relatively important once at here.
